# Changelog

All notable changes to STCI (Standard Token Cost Index) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Rebuilt the public `stci-dataops` skill around evidence provenance,
  legal-review boundaries, the actual collector contract, explicit approvals,
  schema validation, and deterministic tests.
- Corrected public repository links and documented the intentionally paused
  daily pipeline.
- Refreshed locked development dependencies to clear all reported npm audit
  findings without changing production dependencies.

### Fixed

- Repair repository verification under `set -e` so counters no longer terminate
  the script on its first document or warning.
- Make pull-request browser and Lighthouse checks deterministic by testing the
  checked-out static site instead of the intentionally offline production domain.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-04

  - Live market snapshot from daily index API
  - Evidence-backed data with source links and confidence levels
  - Cost optimization features explainer (caching, batching, routing)
  - Methodology and verification documentation
  - Email subscription form with honeypot protection

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Playwright smoke test suite with 19 tests covering all major features
  - GitHub Actions CI pipeline with three jobs:
    - Data validation (JSON Schema + business rules)
    - E2E tests (Playwright)
    - Lighthouse audits with score thresholds

- **Build-Time Validation**:

  - Business rules validation (duplicate IDs, severity rubric, HTTPS sources)
  - JSON-LD generation for SEO structured data

- **Legal Pages**:
  - Privacy policy (`/privacy.html`)
  - Terms of service (`/terms.html`)

  - Added form labels and ARIA attributes
  - Added main landmark element

- Enhanced landing page UI/UX with better spacing and tier explanations

### Fixed

- Firestore initialization for Firebase Functions

- **Read-only HTTP API**: Serves index data, observations, and methodology via REST endpoints
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Canonical schemas for observations (`observation.schema.json`) and daily indices (`stci_daily.schema.json`)
- **Docker Support**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for API server and pipeline execution
- **GCP Cloud Run Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow with Workload Identity Federation
- **Daily Automation**: Cron-based pipeline execution with systemd timer support
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 48 unit tests covering collector, indexer, and API services
- **CLAUDE.md**: Claude Code guidance for development workflows

### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions workflows for CI (tests), CD (deployment), and daily pipeline
- Docker Compose for local development
- Storage backends for local filesystem and Google Cloud Storage

### Documentation

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for index-first strategy, OpenRouter integration, data pipeline, and licensing
- Observation schema specification
